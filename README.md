# Nurses-Stress-Dataset

### Project Name
This project aims to detect stress level changes using physiological signals, specifically electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature, and heart rate. The project uses a sliding window approach to extract features from the physiological signals and applies the cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm to detect changes in stress levels.
